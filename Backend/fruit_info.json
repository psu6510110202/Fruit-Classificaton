In ancient times, grapes were culturally and religiously significant, particularly in Greece and Rome, where they were used to produce wine, a drink linked to rituals and celebrations. Besides wine production, grapes are consumed fresh, dried (raisins), or as grape juice. Grapes have great economic value in the global food and beverage industry. Today, grapes are grown in many regions, including Europe, America, Australia, and Asia, with new varieties developed to meet market demands. Grapes are packed with health benefits, such as antioxidants like resveratrol, which help reduce the risk of heart disease and cancer. They also contain vitamin C and vitamin K, which boost immunity and support bone health. Grapes' natural sugars provide quick energy, and their potassium content helps regulate blood pressure, making them popular in fresh and processed forms, such as juice, wine, and raisins.",
